    <h1>Currently-Watching Anime</h1>
    <p>This page contains all the animes that I am currently watching along with my opinions on them! Feel free to reach out to me to talk about them :) !</p>
    <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
        <img src="images/hunterHunter.jpg" alt="Hunter x Hunter">
        <p>This anime was first aired in 2011, but I am just started watching now. It is a completed anime series with 148 episodes, and I am almost done with it. Overall, it hooked me instantly because of the Gon's, the main character, quick development.</p>
    <h3>Black Clover</h3>
        <img src="images/blackClover.jpg" alt="Black Clover">
        <p><em>Black Clover</em> is still an ongoing anime, but it will turn into a seasonal anime; therefore, the current season will finish sometime in March. I first started watching this anime in high school because I heard that it would be the next "<em>Naruto</em>"</p>
    <h3>Boruto: Naruto Next Generation</h3>
        <img src="images/boruto.jpg" alt="Boruto">
        <p><em>Boruto</em> is a sequel to <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>, which is a sequel to <em>Naruto</em>. This anime gives me mixed feelings because there are parts that are entertaining, but a lot of it can be boring. With the most recent episodes, <em>Boruto</em> is reaching a very interesting time-skip where he is older.</p>
    <h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
        <img src="images/aot.jpg" alt="Attack on Titan">
        <p>This is the one of the most popular anime that is currently running. <em>Attack on Titan</em> is currently on season 4, and it is so encaptivating. The story for this anime is amazing as things start to unravel as you watch, allowing you to connect the dots to certain information given throuhout the anime.</p>
    <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
        <img src="images/jujutsuKaisen.jpg" alt="Jujutsu">
        <P><em>Jujustsu Kaisen</em> is a more recent anime that first aired in October 2020. Although it is still ongoing during this time, all of the episodes have been very suspensful, and there are a lot of well animated fights.</P>
