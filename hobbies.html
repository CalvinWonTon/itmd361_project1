    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>This website contains information about some of my hobbies!</p>
    <h3>Games</h3>
        <img src="images/valorant.jpg" alt="Valorant">
        <p>I love playing video games with friends. Currently, I play a lot of League of Legends and Valorant, but I use to play Minecraft, Apex, and even CS:GO</p>
    <h3>Building a Keyboard</h3>
        <img src="images/keyboard.jpg" alt="Mechanical Keyboard">
        <p>I recently got into a really expensive hobby of building mechanical keyboards. It is so satisfying building keyboards and collecting mechanical switches. This is my first keyboard that I have built and am currently using. I hope to build another keyboard in the future.</p>
    <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <img src="/images/basketball.jpg" alt="Sports">
        <p>I haven't played in a while, but I really enjoy plaing basketball. I played on the team throughout high school, but I haven't played as much due to being busy with work and school. Hopefully, I'll be able to go play soon!</p>
    <h3>Dancing/Singing</h3>

        <p>I started dancing more when I joined Filipinos in Alliance because they had a dance group called FIA Modern. Although I didn't join, I learned a lot of pieces from them because some of the members were my friends. Kinjaz is one of my favorite dance groups, and this is one of their choreographies</p>
    <h3>Building a Set Up</h3>
        <img src="images/setup.jpg" alt="My Setup">
        <p>Another thing I enjoy is building a PC set up. I like to play around with PC Part Picker to build a pc and envision how I would set up my office if I were to live alone. I also help friends build their computers and setups as well. This picture is how my current setup looks like.</p>
